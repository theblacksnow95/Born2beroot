## üìò Practical guide to the project

## 1. Install the virtual machine

### 1.1 Launch VirtualBox
You can download it [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
- You can also use the terminal command:
- `sudo apt update -y`
- `sudo apt upgrade -y`
- `sudo apt-get install VirtualBox`

Once is installed we can download the iso image, for this example I have downloaded Debian iso v24
- Use the next [link](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/) to download the version needed. It spell like this debian-x.x.x-amd64-netinst.iso
- Now we open VirtualBox and create the image
- Select the folder and set a name and click next

## 2. Virtual Machine configuration
### 2.1 Sudo installation and strict configuration
On the CM restart it will ask for your passphrase and your login credentials
Once they are introduced you will be on your shell
Check your partitions usign th lsblk command
- `lsblk`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d996153-8af8-4c75-9027-05d40000b416)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0de6806f-88a7-49b3-b0ea-342ac8ff06b9)

Change to the root user to be able to install packages using the su command
- `su - `

Introduce your host password to change to the root superuse
Use the next commands to update the package list and upgrade it:

- `apt-get update -y`
- `apt-get upgrade -y`

Install sudo usign the next command
- `apt-get install sudo`

Install the vim editor (just if you want, you can also use nano to edit files)
- `apt-get install vim`

Now that sudo is installed we have to add our user to the sudo group and to the sudoers file
To modify the sudoers file we use the visudo command on the root user:
- `sudo visudo`
- look for the line "# user privilege specification" and add the next line
- `<your_username>  ALL=(ALL) ALL`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96a07dd2-d581-4bfc-b55f-f47ec34d9082)

This will grant all the privileges to your user and you can use sudo with it.
Press ctrl+x then "y" and "enter" to save the changes.

To add to a group we use the usermod command with the -aG flag, this means --append --group:
- `sudo usermod -aG <group> <username>`

To check the sudo group and confirm the change was correct:
- `sudo getent group sudo` 
### 2.2 Configuring the sudo strict requisites:
We need to add to the sudoers file the requisites, we can do this in the first part of the sudoers file were the "Defaults" requisites are located
Open the file using the command `sudo visudo` on the root user
The ones we will be using will be the next:
- Defaults      requiretty
- Defaults      badpass_message="Wrong password, please try again"
- Defaults      passwd_tries=3
- Defaults      secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin"
- Defaults      logfile="/var/log/sudo/sudo.log"
- Defaults      log_input, log_output

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8503b87-5dd9-4ff2-bce2-ac2d5d3debe5)

Save this changes and we can create the log file in the "/var/log/sudo/" directory

- `cd /var/log`
- `mkdir sudo`
- `touch sudo.log`

Use a sudo command to verify that the log is working and then check the log file using cat

- `sudo getent group sudo`
- `cat /var/log/sudo/sudo.log`

You should see the last used command with sudo:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6780c1b6-b2be-4d8b-8cbf-efbcb788ae69)

### 2.3 Strong password configuration
To be able to have a secure password policy we will install the libpam-pwquality package

- `sudo apt install libpam-pwquality -y`

Once installed we will modify the common-password file at the /etc/pam.d/common-password using Vim

- `sudo vim /etc/pam.d/common-password`

We will the next text after the "# here are the pre-package modules (the "Primary" block)" after the "retry=3"

- **minlen=10 lcredit=-1 ucredit=-1 dcredit=-1 maxrepeat=3 difok=7 reject_username enforce_for_root**

We can also use the pwquality.config file

- `sudo vim /security/pwquality.config`

And set all the values needed in this file, it does the same and we can use both.

Save the file and exit
Now we hace to modify the login defs to set the password expiry dates
This we can do using the login.defs file and look for the "#password aging controls"

- `sudo vim /etc/login.defs`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/346a2546-0e0a-42a9-b42a-a0c0e46437fd)

The result must be like this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2464753-c401-4d07-bf5a-79acb4e27040)

Check yur user or the root aging with the `chage` command

-  `sudo chage -l <your_user>`

You will see that the numbers have not changed, in this case use the `chage` command to modify them

- `sudo chage -M 30 <login>` for the maxdays
- `sudo chage -m 2 <login>` for the mindays
- `sudo chage -W 7 <login>` for the warning days

Repeat this for the root user and your user to make sure it is done, for the new users it should be the new default

## 3. Configuring the SSH and UFW services
### 3.1 Installing SSH

The SSH allows to connect to the machine using an encripted secure shell connection.
To install it we need to use the next command

- `sudo apt install openssh-server -y`
- `sudo systemctl status ssh` to check the status and the default port

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47f1f155-341f-4eea-bdc4-98a4d2c1898e)


Now we have to modify the default port connection to 4242

- `sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd-config`

Edit the line #Port 22 to Port 4242

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aaeaa9ec-72ac-4f2e-bb36-4eb17fd9f351)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f976abdd-8aec-4868-873a-8c6a23d30436)

Restart the ssh service 

- `sudo systemctl restart ssh`

And check that the port has been modified correctly

- `sudo systemctl status ssh`

### 3.2 Installing UFW

Install the UFW to configure the firewall

- `sudo apt install ufw -y`

Check the status to verify is active

- `sudo systemctl status ufw`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6db6e750-f7ce-41a4-8632-b3698fb88c33)

In the case that it does not show as "active" or "diabled", set ufw active on system startup

- `sudo ufw enable`

Next add the rule for the port 4242 to be able to connect using this port only
Check the rules with the next command

- `sudo ufw status numbered`
- `sudo ufw allow 4242`
- `sudo ufw status numbered`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d174285-831f-46e7-808f-9ad04f7ea736)

Open the VirtualBox settings for the machine
Go to "network" then "advanced" and click on "Port Forwarding"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2af7384-040a-466a-8915-9dedd602f818)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e61f9e38-50de-45f3-9d0a-9bbeb096775d)

To verify that the configuration is correct we can connect using a terminar from our computer
Open a terminal and use the ssh to connect

- `ssh <your_user>@localhost -p 4242`
- exit to disconnect

## 4. Groups and hosts 
### 4.1 Group creation

To create a new group we can use the next command

- `sudo addgroup user42`

Check all the groups available

- `sudo getent group`

You can also check individual groups

- `sudo getent group user42 sudo`

### 4.2 User creation

Add your user to the group

- `sudo usermod -aG user42 <your_username>`

To create a new user use:

- `sudo adduser <new_username>`

Set a new password that follows the new rules

### 4.3 Password change

If you need to change a user password

- `sudo passwd <username>`

Reboot the system to apply changes

### 4.4 Modifying the host name
To modify the host name we just need to change two things
Set the new hostname using the command:

- `sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <new_hostname>`

Once this is done we have to edit the hosts file in the /etc/hosts directory

- `sudo vim /etc/hosts`

Change the host name for the new name in the correct format, save and exit
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ebccca1-f913-48da-a927-eed5896f2a41)

After the change we need to reboot to make the changes available

## 5. Creating a monitoring script
We need to install net-tools 

- `sudo apt install net-tools -y
- Go to `/usr/local/bin`
- create the file with touch `touch monitoring.sh`
- use chmod `sudo chmod 777 monitoring.sh`
- fill your script with the commands needed.

Go to the visudo file using `sudo visudo`
Add the line "<username>  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh" after the %sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

Save the file and reboot the system with `sudo reboot`

### Set the crontab
Crontab is a table of automated commands and scripts

- `sudo crontab -u root -e`

Add the next line to the end of the file to set the script every 10 minutes

- `*/10 * * * * /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh`

By now you should have finished the configuration now its up to you to find the information needed to pass your evaluation.
